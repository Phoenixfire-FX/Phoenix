# My First GitHub Commit ðŸš€

Welcome to my very first GitHub project!  
This repository is created to practice how commits work directly on the GitHub website.

## About This Repo
This is a simple test repository to understand:
- How to create a file on GitHub
- How to write a commit message
- How to commit changes directly on the web

## Next Steps
I will later:
- Clone this repository to my local computer
- Learn how to make commits using Git commands
- Push those commits back to GitHub
